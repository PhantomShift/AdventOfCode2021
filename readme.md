## Advent of Code 2021
My own solutions to the Advent of Code 2021, which I participated in for the first time.

These solutions are essentially me practicing/learning C++ as I have just begun to explore the language. Given solutions are not necessarily well optimized in either speed n'or size but they do work, so I at least have that going for me.

All solutions are written/compiled for the C++20 standard.
